    <h2>Description about the Island</h2>
<p>Mauritius, island country in the Indian Ocean, located off the eastern coast of Africa. Physiographically, it is part of the Mascarene Islands. The capital is Port Louis. </p>
<h3>Land</h3>
<p>Mauritius lies about 500 miles (800 km) east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Its outlying territories are Rodrigues Island, situated about 340 miles (550 km) eastward, the Cargados Carajos Shoals, 250 miles (400 km) northeastward, and the Agalega Islands, 580 miles (930 km) northward from the main island. Mauritius also claims sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago (including Diego Garcia), some 1,250 miles (2,000 km) to the northeast, although this claim is disputed by Britain.</p>
<h3>Cultural Life</h3>
<p>Mauritius offers a rich mixture of the many cultures and traditions of its different peoples. The ethnic and religious diversity of Mauritius also means that there are many holidays and festivals scheduled throughout the year, including the Hindu festivals of Maha Shivaratree (see Mahā-śivarātrī) in February and March and Divali in late October and November; the Muslim festival of ʿĪd al-Fiṭr, marking the end of Ramadan; the Catholic observances in honour of Père Laval in September, All Saints’ Day in November, and Christmas in December; the lively Chinese Spring Festival celebration; and the Tamil holiday of Thaipoosam Cavadee, usually held in January or February, which includes fire-walking ceremonies. The entire country observes Abolition of Slavery Day on February 1, Republic Day on March 12, Labour Day on May 1, and Arrival of Indentured Laborers Day on November 2.</p>
